# Stellarnode.sh
Creates a Stellar node from sources, tested on Debian 9.  
Will require root privileges during execution.  
It has been written during the writing of a tutorial about setting up stellar-core on Debian from sources on [crypto-lyon.fr](https://www.crypto-lyon.fr/)
  
  
# Config.cfg
Configuration adapted to my needs, you may want to change some parameters (like peers and TARGET_PEERS_CONNECTION) before running the script.
